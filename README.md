# Liver-Disease-Prediction

Aimed to predit gender based on liver disease. Python was the major language used for EDA and prediction and multivariate analysis was carried out using tableau.
The data contained 583 records, missing values were handled using the 'most frequent' values, correlation analysis was performed to see the relationship between the varibles in the dataset, a resampling technique was adopted to deal with the imbalanced data and the data was then split into 90% training and 10% testing. The random forest classifer was used for the prediction and it achieved a precision score of 93% and a recall of 89%.
